This is the repository of Michael Cuffney.

I am a MPH-Applied Biostatistic.

I am from Raleigh, NC and am a fan of Carolina Hurricanes hockey team.

Changes to the Readme file were done locally and then staged and pushed to GitHub via GitKraken.

It took a little bit of time to get used to how github and gitkraken worked, still getting used to it.

I have only a little bit of experience with markdown files via R markdown.
